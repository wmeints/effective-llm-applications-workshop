title: Why use Aspire for building LLM-based applications?
---

Building LLM-based applications, and especially RAG applications, involves many moving
parts. First and foremost, you have to deal with a language model hosted in the cloud.
Next, you must record history and store documents in a vector database. Finally, you
need to combine the front end and APIs into a working application.

Combining all these components is a lot of work. But there's is a solution: .NET Aspire.
A new framework from Microsoft that helps developers build distributed applications.

Aspire has a couple of components to it that matter for building LLM-based applications:

1. **The application host** serves as an orchestrator, putting all the moving parts
   together so you can run the infrastructure, API, and front end by starting an
   application host project.

2. **The Aspire dashboard** exposes metrics, logging, and tracing in a single website
   for all the components in the solution. It makes it a lot easier to debug
   interactions in your LLM-based application. Also, it helps you discover other
   important information like the URL for the frontend, etc.

3. **The service defaults** provide applicable base settings necessary to collect the
   diagnostics for the dashboard and other general-purpose code for the distributed
   application.

While Aspire mainly focuses on orchestrating distributed applications, you can generate
deployment scripts using the application model you create in the application host. For
example, you can easily use the [Azure Developer CLI][AZD] to deploy an Aspire-based
application to Azure.

For the purpose of this workshop, we ensured that the application host and service
defaults are preconfigured for you. We highly recommend copying the code from the
starter folder in each lab to ensure the right configuration.

If you feel up to it, you can configure the application host yourself by following these
two tutorials:
